//! Fingerprint randomization policy.
//!
//! Selects *how much* of the client fingerprint varies and *toward what*
//! (real vs synthetic). The **scope** at which a given dimension varies
//! (per-session identity vs per-connection jitter) is derived automatically
//! from wire timing — it is not a free user choice. See the tier list below
//! for the full model.
//!
//! Construct a policy with a named tier and pass it to
//! [`ClientBuilder::randomize`](crate::client::ClientBuilder::randomize):
//!
//! ```rust
//! use lkrequest::{Client, Randomize};
//!
//! // Force Chrome-style per-connection extension-order jitter on.
//! let client = Client::builder()
//!     .randomize(Randomize::extension_order())
//!     .build();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Tiers
//!
//! Always available:
//!
//! - [`Randomize::off`] — **Tier 0**: emit the preset's fingerprint as-is (the
//!   preset's own authentic per-connection behavior, e.g. Chrome's native
//!   extension shuffle, still applies — `off` adds nothing on top).
//! - [`Randomize::extension_order`] — **Tier 1**: force per-connection
//!   extension-order permutation (BoringSSL-style; GREASE bookends pinned,
//!   `pre_shared_key` last). Drifts JA3 per connection **while staying a real
//!   browser**; JA4 is unaffected (it sorts extensions). This is the *safe*
//!   single-layer (TLS-only) option — it never produces a non-browser shape.
//!
//! Behind the off-by-default **`synthetic-fp`** feature (these synthesize
//! fingerprints that match *no* real browser — an escape hatch for
//! negative-model / blocklist targets only; against an allowlist they fail
//! instantly):
//!
//! - `Randomize::recombine` — **Tier 3a**: one novel-but-capability-safe
//!   identity per session, recombined from the real-preset corpus across **all**
//!   layers (TLS + H2 + H3). `Randomize::recombine_layers` restricts it to a
//!   `Layers` subset.
//! - `Randomize::full` — **Tier 3b**: the widest synthesis — like recombine,
//!   but the advertise-only layers (H2 SETTINGS, QUIC transport-param values)
//!   additionally take novel out-of-corpus numbers. `Randomize::full_layers`
//!   restricts it to a `Layers` subset.
//!
//! ### "No layer left constant"
//!
//! `recombine`/`full` synthesize **every** layer by default. Half-synthesis (a
//! novel TLS fingerprint next to an unchanged Chrome H2 profile) is itself an
//! anomalous combination, easier to flag than full synthesis — so the per-layer
//! `Layers` variants are a deliberate opt-in, not the default.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "synthetic-fp")] {
//! use lkrequest::{Client, Randomize, Layers};
//!
//! // A fresh synthetic identity per session, all layers (the safe default).
//! let client = Client::builder()
//!     .randomize(Randomize::recombine())
//!     .build();
//!
//! // Widest divergence (novel H2/QUIC values too), all layers.
//! let client = Client::builder()
//!     .randomize(Randomize::full())
//!     .build();
//!
//! // Deliberate subset: synthesize only TLS, keep the real H2/H3 preset.
//! let client = Client::builder()
//!     .randomize(Randomize::recombine_layers(Layers::TLS))
//!     .build();
//!
//! // Synthesize TLS + H2 together (compose any subset with `|`).
//! let client = Client::builder()
//!     .randomize(Randomize::recombine_layers(Layers::TLS | Layers::H2))
//!     .build();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Each session draws its own seed, so two sessions from the same synthetic
//! client present different (but each internally consistent) fingerprints; a
//! synthetic session also gets its own TLS/QUIC ticket cache so resuming cannot
//! link two identities. Per-connection randomness (GREASE values, key shares)
//! stays random on top — as in a real browser — it is intentionally **not**
//! seed-derived.
