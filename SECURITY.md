# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in `lkrequest`, please report it
**privately**. Do **not** open a public GitHub issue, pull request, or
discussion for security-sensitive matters, as that may expose other users to
risk before a fix is available.

- **Contact:** email `admin@ez-xlabs.com` with the subject line prefixed
  `[lkrequest security]`.
- **Include (where possible):** affected crate(s) and version/commit, a
  description of the issue and its impact, reproduction steps or a
  proof-of-concept, and any suggested remediation.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement:** we aim to acknowledge your report within **72 hours**.
- **Triage & updates:** after acknowledgement we will work to confirm the
  issue, assess severity and impact, and keep you informed of progress.
- **Coordinated disclosure:** we follow a coordinated-disclosure model. We ask
  that you give us a reasonable window to develop and ship a fix before any
  public disclosure, and we will credit reporters who wish to be named once a
  fix is released. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have
  agreed on a disclosure timeline.

This project is pre-1.0 research software. Response times are best-effort and
are not backed by a contractual SLA.

| ------- | ---------------------------------- |

`lkrequest` has not yet reached a stable 1.0 release. The `0.1.x` line is
pre-release software; security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis and
typically land in the latest commit rather than as backported point releases.
There are no guarantees of long-term support for any version prior to a stable
release. Always track the latest published version for the most current fixes.

## Intended Use / Responsible Use

`lkrequest` provides byte-level control over TLS, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3/QUIC wire
formats in order to emulate real browser network fingerprints. This capability
is powerful and is intended for **legitimate, authorized use only**.

**Intended uses include:**

- Authorized security testing and red-team engagements where you have explicit
  permission to test the target.
- Anti-bot, fingerprinting, and browser-emulation **research**.
- Web scraping and automation of sites that **you own** or that you are
  **explicitly authorized** to access, in compliance with their terms.
- Building and validating browser-fidelity / fingerprint-consistency tooling.
- Privacy and network-protocol research and education.

**You must NOT use `lkrequest` to:**

- Bypass authentication, authorization, or other access controls on systems you
  do not own or are not authorized to access.
- Violate a site's Terms of Service, robots directives, rate limits, or
  applicable laws and regulations (including computer-misuse, anti-fraud, and
  data-protection law).
- Evade or defeat fraud-prevention, abuse-prevention, or security controls in
  order to commit fraud, abuse, or other unlawful activity.
- Conduct credential stuffing, denial-of-service, spam, scalping, ad fraud, or
  any other abusive or malicious activity.
- Misrepresent your identity or affiliation in a manner that is deceptive or
  unlawful.
