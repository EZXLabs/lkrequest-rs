# fpverify — fingerprint verification core & developer guide

`fpverify` is the **client-agnostic** byte-level fingerprint machinery used by
lkrequest's fingerprint-regression gate: canonical (normalized) fingerprint
types, the GREASE/shape normalizer, the per-profile shape spec, the shape-aware
comparator, and capture decoding.

> **Client-agnostic invariant — keep it extractable.** Everything here operates
> on *raw/parsed* fingerprint bytes (a parsed ClientHello, H2 frames, a QUIC
> Initial). It does **not** depend on `lkrequest` or any HTTP client, so the
> same tooling is reusable by any browser-emulation / anti-bot project. **Do not
> add an `lkrequest` dependency to this crate.** The lkrequest-specific gate
> (which emits lkrequest's own bytes and compares committed goldens) lives in
> `lkrequest/tests/` with `fpverify` as a dev-dependency.

This README is the **developer guide** for working on / verifying fingerprints.
It includes the current design rationale and test-tier policy for the tracked
checkout.

## 1. The verification model (three layers)

Each layer answers a different question. Use the right one for the change you
make.

| Layer | Where | Answers | Network / browser | When to run |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **A — offline gate** | `lkrequest/tests/fingerprint_regression.rs` | "Did the on-wire fingerprint change vs the frozen snapshot?" | none (Tier 0) | every change; CI |
| **B — real-browser** | `lkrequest/tests/b_layer_real_chrome.rs` | "Does the snapshot still equal a *real* Chrome?" | real Chrome + network (Tier 2, `#[ignore]`) | when you change a profile / add a version |
| **wire-level** | `lkrequest/tests/quic_local_e2e.rs`, focused `lktls` ClientHello tests | exact randomized GREASE values, extension permutation, PRIORITY_UPDATE / control-stream frames | loopback only | when you touch those areas |

Why three layers? The A-layer tokenizes GREASE **values in place**, preserving
their slots in cipher suites, supported groups, supported versions, key shares,
and signature algorithms while still allowing captures with different random
code points to compare equal. For profiles that shuffle extensions, their exact
per-connection extension order is folded away by the shape spec. Wire-level
tests cover the randomized values, permutation rules, and control-stream frames;
the B-layer proves a (re)frozen snapshot is actually Chrome-shaped.

Chrome 152 demonstrates why the ordered raw fields matter: JA3/JA3N omit
`signature_algorithms`, and JA4 strips GREASE, so all three can match while the
leading sigalgs GREASE slot is absent. Peetprint retains that slot. The Chrome
152 golden therefore stores `GREASE_TOKEN` at `signature_algorithms[0]`, which
ignores only the random code point and still fails if the slot moves or vanishes.

> **Mental model:** A-layer catches *"did it change"* (run always, blocks
> regressions). B-layer catches *"is it correct"* (run when changing a profile).
> `UPDATE_FINGERPRINTS=1` only **re-freezes** the snapshot — it is **not**
> verification. Correctness is proven by the B-layer.

## 2. Environment setup

Prerequisites:

```bash
# 1. Submodules are mandatory — deps/quinn and deps/h3 are patched forks
#    (branch `lkrequest-patches`) referenced by path.
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. NASM (for aws-lc-rs prebuilt paths). Linux CI also needs cmake + libclang:
#    apt-get install nasm cmake libclang-dev
#    Windows: install NASM and ensure it is on PATH.

# 3. Build the workspace (Tier 0, no network, no QUIC)
cargo build --workspace
```

Extra tooling, only for the layer you run:

- **B-layer (real Chrome):** a locally installed Chrome/Chromium. The
  `headless_chrome` crate locates it via `default_executable()`. No extra setup
  beyond having Chrome on the machine.
- **pcap debugging (optional):** `tshark`/Wireshark, used ad-hoc to inspect raw
  bytes. Note: QUIC needs `SSLKEYLOGFILE` to decrypt, and a host that does *not*
  route QUIC through a TCP-only proxy (a TUN proxy will force Chrome back to H2).
  For control-stream inspection a local instrumented H3 server (see §5) is more
  reliable than decrypting public traffic.
- **FFI work (unrelated to fpverify):** `cargo install cbindgen --locked`.

Shell on Windows is bash — use Unix paths/redirects.

## 3. Verify a fingerprint change

```bash
# ① Run the offline gate (add --features quic-h3 to include the QUIC/H3 gates).
cargo test -p lkrequest --features quic-h3 --test fingerprint_regression
```

- **Passes** → your change did not alter any gated wire fingerprint (or you
  added a preset not yet wired into the gate — see §4).
- **Fails** → it prints a per-field diff. Decide which case you are in:
  - **You did *not* intend to change the fingerprint** → this is a **regression**.
    Fix the code. Do **not** regenerate the golden.
  - **You *did* intend it** (new capture / profile update) → regenerate, then
    validate:

```bash
# ② Re-freeze the golden(s) to the new output. (Re-freeze ≠ verify.)
UPDATE_FINGERPRINTS=1 cargo test -p lkrequest --features quic-h3 --test fingerprint_regression

# ③ Prove the new golden matches a REAL Chrome (this is the actual verification).
TEST_ALLOW_NETWORK=1 cargo test -p lkrequest --features quic-h3 \
  --test b_layer_real_chrome -- --ignored --nocapture

# ④ If you touched GREASE / priority / control-stream emission, also run the
#    focused wire-level tests for the exact emission rules:
cargo test -p lkrequest --features quic-h3 --test quic_local_e2e
cargo test -p lktls shuffle_pins_grease
```

Goldens live in `lkrequest/tests/fixtures/fingerprints/`. Commit the regenerated
golden together with the code change.

---

## 4. Add a new browser / version (e.g. `chrome_149`)

1. Add the profile data: `lktls/profiles/*.json` + `lktls::profile::presets`,
   `lkh2::profile`, `lkh3` (capture it — see §5, don't hand-edit to pass tests).
2. Register it in the gate macros in `fingerprint_regression.rs`
   (`tls_gate!` / `h2_gate!` / `quic_gate!`).
3. `UPDATE_FINGERPRINTS=1 …` to mint its golden.
4. Run the **B-layer** to confirm it matches the real browser.
5. Commit goldens + code together.

---

## 5. Capturing ground truth

- **Profiles** are captured from real browsers with
  `tools/profile_collector` (headless Chrome →
  TLS/H2/QUIC capture → lkrequest preset export → field-level compare). This is
  how `lktls/profiles/*.json` are produced — recapture when the target browser
  version actually changes; never hand-edit a golden to make a test pass.
- **Control-stream / priority behaviour** (PRIORITY_UPDATE frames, the
  `priority` header, control-stream GREASE frame) is captured with a **local
  instrumented H3 server** that real Chrome is forced onto, so the server reads
  the decrypted frames directly:
  - Force H3: `--origin-to-force-quic-on=127.0.0.1:PORT` +
    `--ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=<base64 SHA256 of the cert SPKI>`.
  - **Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`** — `localhost` resolves to `::1`, an
    IPv4 server never sees the packets, and Chrome reports
    `ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`.
  - This method is reusable per Chrome version (priority values shift across
    versions).

## 6. Library API (for reuse in another client)

```rust
use fpverify::{
    CanonicalTlsFingerprint, canonicalize_tls, TlsShapeSpec, diff_values,
};

// 1. Parse your client's emitted ClientHello into a CanonicalTlsFingerprint.
let canonical = CanonicalTlsFingerprint::from_parsed(&parsed_client_hello);

// 2. Pick a shape: fixed_order(), or shuffled(pinned_last) for browsers that
//    permute extensions (Chrome pins only pre_shared_key, 0x0029, last).
let shape = TlsShapeSpec::shuffled(vec![0x0029]);

// 3. Canonicalize (folds away per-connection GREASE + the permutation) and
//    serialize to a comparable JSON value, then diff against a golden.
let comparable = canonicalize_tls(&canonical, &shape);
let diffs = diff_values(&golden_json, &serde_json::to_value(&comparable)?);
assert!(diffs.is_empty());
```

Modules / exports:

- `canonical` — `CanonicalTlsFingerprint::from_parsed`, `tokenize`,
  `GREASE_TOKEN`, `CanonicalExtension`, `CanonicalExtSource`.
- `shape` — `TlsShapeSpec::{fixed_order, shuffled}`.
- `compare` — `canonicalize_tls`, `diff_tls`, `diff_values`, `diff_json`,
  `FieldDiff`.

`diff_values` / `diff_json` are generic JSON diffs, so the same compare/golden
workflow extends to H2 and QUIC fingerprints (as the lkrequest gate does).
